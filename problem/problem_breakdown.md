You're going to build a bookmark manager.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a `collection of bookmarks` (URLs).

You can use it to `save a webpage` you found useful.

You can `add tags` to the webpages you saved to find them later.

You can `browse` bookmarks other users have added. You can `comment` on the bookmarks.
